# SpenceGnomeTheme

My personalized gnome theme for 18.04 ubuntu installs, adapted from
[https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors](https://github.com/Jannomag/Yaru-Colors).

Running install also installs the [Red Hat
Fonts](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont) and the `gnome-tweak-tool`
apt package.

Installs all locally with `install.sh`.

Requirements:

* [User Themes Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/)

After install, open Tweaks and select Yaru color theme for apps and Spence
Theme for the gnome-shell theme. Might need to Alt-F2 'r' to restart Gnome.
